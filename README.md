## Reflection

This project was made to practice my Typescript and React skills as well as learn new ones. Project goals included to practice mainly front end side. Mock-up API is used as a backend to this project. However it appeared that it does not perform as expected when searching data. So I am in process of building my own backend and db for this project. 

UPD: Mock-up API was substituted by backened made with Express.js and MongoDB.

The project is still work in progress and several features are being built. Currently I am working on "Build Your Own Pizza" feature. 

At the end of the day, the technologies and practices implemented in this project are 
- TypeScript 
- React (hooks) 
- React-Router v.6
- Redux Toolkit
- Lodash.Debounce
- Lazy loading 
- Code splitting
- re render optimization 
- responsive design. 
-SCSS. Modular CSS
